An experiment to support SPM and also XCFramework for Midtrans SDK.


Usage:

1. Installation via SPM ( Swift Package Manager): You can add dependency to your project by copy pasting this current repo url `https://github.com/uziwuzzy/MidtransSPM`.


2. Manual Installation: You can just drag and drop the `.xcframework` file inside the `XCFramework` folder. If you use the MidtransKit(`MidtransKit.xcframework`) please make sure to also include MidtransCoreKit in your Project.
